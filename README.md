# ToDolist
This project was created as a learning exercise for Android Studio/Java, so, it is very rudimentary, but i intend in making it better.

Now, the application works with a DataBase SQLite so that it can storage the tasks the users will type, it also has a funcionality to
delete a task if you press on it for a few seconds and wait for a alert to show up.

I'll add more features in a near future, such as different tabs for different kinds of tasks, each one storaged in its own table in the DataBase.
For those different tabs to be implemented a side menu/navigation menu will be implemented as well to make things easy and modern.
